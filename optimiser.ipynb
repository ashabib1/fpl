    "The English Premier League (EPL) is ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Fantasy Premier League\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online strategy game that casts the player in the role of a Fantasy manager. Each manager assembles a virtual team of real-life football players in the English Premier League and score points based on their real-life performance in their Premier League matches. The goal for each manager in FPL is to maximise their points by the end of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the season, managers are allocated a budget of £100 million to build their team of 15 players. Prices of players are assigned at the beginning of the season, then they fluctuate throughout the season based on their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points are awarded to players for goals, assists, saves, clean sheets as well as bonus points, which are awarded to the top-performing individuals in a match. Points can also be taken away for yellow cards, red cards and goals conceded. A team's points for the match round or \"gameweek\" will be scored by the starting XI. There are 38 gameweeks every season; one for each match.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal & Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "FPL is a popular game amongst fans of the English Premier League, as Fantasy managers attempt to build the optimal combination of players every gameweek. Fantasy managers can only guess the optimal combination of players, because they must pick their teams before any real-life Premier League games occur. In other words, there is *uncertainty* regarding which players will perform the best. For this project, we will be removing this uncertainty by using the FPL dataset of the 2016-2017 season, which has already recorded the highest performing players for every gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is considered to be an optimisation problem, because we are attempting to maximise the total number of points of our team in the 2016-2017 season, whilst adhering to a multitude of different constraints.  There are many constraints that we must consider, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position Constraint: Each manager must select a team of 15 players, consisting of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders, and 3 forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Price Constraint: The total price of the 15 players cannot exceed £100 million at the beginning of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Formation Constraint: The starting XI of each team must play with a formation of 1 goalkeeper, 3-5 defeneders, 2-5 midfielders, and 1-3 forwards. The remaining four players would be on the bench, but the chosen formation can change before each gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Team Constraint: Each manager can have a maximum of three players from the same Premier League team at any point in the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Transfer Constraint: Each manager is allowed one free transfer per week. Any subsequent transfers results in a four-point deduction for that gameweek. A manager can transfer or \"exchange\" any of their players for a different player, given that the price constraint still holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints will make the calculation of the optimal team more difficult, as we cannot just pick the highest-scroing players from each gameweek. We can classify these constraints into \"team-building constraints\" and the \"team-evaluating constraint\". The first four of these constraints interfere with the building of the team, in the sense that the team would be invalid of they are not satisfied. The last constraint, the transfer constraint is considered a \"team-evaluating constraint\" because it does not interfere with the building of the team. Having more transfers does not invalidate a team, but rather \"punishes\" teams for transfering more players by decreasing the total number of points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some extra rules in FPL that can help managers increase their points total. Captaincy should be assigned every week and the Wildcard can be used twice a week. The three chips can only be used in a single gameweek. Here are some more in depth descriptions of the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Captaincy: One player every week can be named captain. Their points are doubled for that gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bench Boost Chip: The points scored by the bench players in the next gameweek are included in the points total.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Free Hit Chip: Make unlimited free transfers for a single gameweek. At the next deadline, the squad is returned to how it was at the start of the gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Triple Captain Chip: The captain points are tripled instead of doubled for that gameweek.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Wildcard: All transfers in the gameweek are free of charge. Each manager gets two wildcards; one in the first half of the season and one in the second half of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be using three classes. The team of the week (totw) class helps us find the players that score the highest number of points in a given gameweek. The team of the year (toty) class helps us find the players that cumulatively score the highest number of points in a range of gameweeks. The evaulate class helps us evaluate the number of points achieved in a season, given a list of players for every gameweek. Here is a list of the classes:"
