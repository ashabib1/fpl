# FPL Project

## Introduction to Fantasy Premier League

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online strategy game that casts the player in the role of a Fantasy manager. Each manager assembles a virtual team of real-life football players in the English Premier League (EPL) and score points based on their performance in their Premier League matches. The goal for each manager in FPL is to maximise their points by the end of the season.

At the beginning of the season, managers are allocated a budget of Â£100 million to build their team of 15 players. Prices are assigned at the beginning of the season, then they fluctuate throughout the season based on their performance.

Points for awarded to players for goals, assists, saves, clean sheets as well as bonus points, which are awarded to the top-performing individuals in a match. Points can also be taken away for yellow cards, red cards and goals conceded. A team's points for the match round or "gameweek" will be scored by the starting XI.

## Project Goal

The FPL game can be considered an optimisation problem, because we are attempting to maximise the total number of points of our squad in a one-season time period with a multitude of different constraints. The goal of this project is to find the highest scoring team over a sesason give the FPL constraints. I will be using the 2016-2017 FPL data to find an optimal combination of players to maximize the number of points scored over the season..
