# FPL Project

## Introduction to Fantasy Premier League

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online strategy game that casts the player in the role of a Fantasy manager. Each player assembles a virtual team of real-life football players in the English Premier League (EPL) and score points based on their performance in their Premier League matches. The goal of each player in FPL is to maximise their points by the end of the season.

Points for awarded to players for goals, assists, saves, clean sheets and bonus points. Points can also be taken away for yellow cards, red cards and goals conceded.

At the beginning of the season, players are allocated a budget of Â£100 million to build their team of 15 players, consisting of two goalkeepers, five defenders, five midfielders and three forwards.
