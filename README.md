# Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Project

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online strategy game that casts the player in the role of a Fantasy manager. Each manager assembles a virtual team of real-life football players in the English Premier League and scores points based on their real-life performance in their Premier League matches. The goal for each manager in FPL is to maximise their points by the end of the season.

This Fantasy Premier League Project attempts to find an optimal strategy to maximise the number of points for the 2016-2017 FPL season. The [optimiser.ipynb](https://github.com/ashabib1/fpl/blob/main/optimiser.ipynb) file above contains the full analysis of the FPL optimisations, whilst the other python files contain the main code of the project. This [blog](https://ashabib1.github.io/blog/) site contains a more high-level overview of the project with less emphasis on the code, and this [binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/ashabib1-fpl-vjaxm5zw) allows the user to interact with this repository.
